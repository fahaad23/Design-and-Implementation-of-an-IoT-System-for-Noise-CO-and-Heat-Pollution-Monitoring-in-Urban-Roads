Urban environments like Dhaka face serious environmental challenges, with noise, CO₂, and heat pollution from road traffic create significant public health risks. Regular monitoring systems are often too costly and static to provide the real-time, localized data necessary for effective intervention. This thesis addresses this problem by designing and implementing a complete, low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) system for monitoring and predicting urban road pollution. The system integrates an Arduino Nano microcontroller with KY-037 (noise), ENS160 (CO₂), and AHT21 (temperature) sensors to collect real-time data. This data is transmitted via MQTT protocol to a local server, where it is stored and analyzed.
A key contribution of this work is the development of a machine learning model that classifies environmental health. Using Logistic Regression, the system predicts whether conditions are "Healthy" or "Unhealthy" based on sensor inputs. The model was validated using collected road data, achieving a high prediction accuracy of 90.34% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.95, demonstrating strong reliability. An interactive Streamlit-based dashboard was developed to visualize real-time data and model predictions, providing an accessible tool for citizens and policymakers. This research concludes that the fusion of IoT and machine learning offers a viable, scalable, and cost-effective framework for smart environmental monitoring, with significant potential for application in smart city initiatives.
